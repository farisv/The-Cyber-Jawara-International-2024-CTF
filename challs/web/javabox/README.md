## Description
I used to hate black box web challenges in CTFs, but then I remembered, my day job as a pentester also requires black box testing. Sometimes, what seems like a black box isnâ€™t so black after all.

## Service Information
A Java web run with Docker on port 20001.

## Release
N/A

## Flag
`CJ{black_box_web_testing_is_not_that_bad_and_too_guessy_right?}`
